# FireExitGuard: Vision-Based Egress Monitoring
 
## Overview
 
FireExitGuard is a computer vision project designed to enhance the safety of buildings by monitoring and detecting blockages in fire exit gates. The system utilizes advanced image processing techniques to analyze real-time video feeds and alert users if any obstructions are detected in the designated fire exit paths.
 
## Key Features
 
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuous analysis of video streams to ensure immediate detection of blockages.
 
- **AI-Powered Vision:** Utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms to identify and classify objects obstructing the fire exit gate.
 
- **Alert System:** Instantaneous alerts via notifications or alarms when a potential blockage is detected.
 
- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive dashboard for users to monitor the status of fire exit gates, view historical data, and configure system settings.
